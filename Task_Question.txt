## JavaScript Challenge: Student Grading System

### Task Description:

Create a JavaScript program that models a student grading system using a class named `Student`.
The program should allow the dynamic creation of multiple student objects and display their details,
including name, age, exam score, and calculated grade.

### Requirements:

1. **Class Definition:**
   - Implement a class named `Student` with a constructor that takes parameters for `name`, `age`,
    and `examScore`.
   - Include a method named `calculateGrade` within the class to determine the grade based
    on the following criteria:
     - A score of 90 and above: "A"
     - A score between 80 and 89: "B"
     - A score between 70 and 79: "C"
     - A score below 70: "D"

2. **Instance Creation:**
   - Create at least three instances of the `Student` class with different names, ages, 
   and exam scores.

3. **Array of Students:**
   - Store the created instances in an array named `studentList`.

4. **Display Details:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through the `studentList` and display the details of each student, 
   including their name, age, exam score, and grade.

### Example:

```Output
// Example Output
// Student 1:
// Name: John, Age: 20, Exam Score: 95, Grade: A
// ...
